# Measure database connection count

<Tag>Added in 4.6.0</Tag>

The server can be configured to report in the logs the amount of active and total 
connections that your database is currently handling.

The report will look like this

```
Database connection count report => DB object id: 69da4799-ea7d-49a4-8628-949f4d1e876a
Database connection count report => Connections in use: 1
Database connection count report => Total connections: 10
```

This report will run at a set interval (every second by default).

To enable, simply add the `dbConnectionReporter` to your desired config:

```js
{
  // ...other config options
  dbConnectionReporter: true,
}
```

If you want to adjust the interval, pass an object to the key instead:

```js
{
  // ...other config options
  dbConnectionReporter: {
    interval: 4000, // report will now run every 4 seconds
  },
}
```

Interval values are in milliseconds.
