# CORS origin

<Tag>Added in 4.5.0</Tag>

The value of CORS origin in coko server is affected by two config values:
* `clientUrl`
* `corsOrigin`

The final result of this value will act as a whitelist of urls that the server
will accept requests from.

If `clientUrl` is given a value, it will always be part of the whitelist.

`corsOrigin` will then act as an extension of the whitelist. Its value can either
be a string (multiple values can be separated by comma) or an array of strings.

:::tip
The value of the CORS origin whitelist will be logged as the server starts, so 
look at the startup logs if unsure.
:::

## Set up in your app

It is recommended that you set these values up in your app to be read through
environment variables.

For example:
```js
// config/custom-environment-variables.js

module.exports = {
  // ...other values
  clientUrl: 'CLIENT_URL',
  corsOrigin: 'CORS_ORIGIN',
}
```

## Recipes

_All recipes assume you are using environment variables to control the values._

:::warning
If adding values to a docker compose file, omit the quotes around the values.
:::

### Only allow requests from your client

* Do not pass any value to `CORS_ORIGIN`.  
* Pass your client url to the `CLIENT_URL` variable.

e.g.  
If your client is hosted at `https://www.myapp.com`, your environment
variables should look like

```bash
CLIENT_URL='https://www.myapp.com'
```

### You do not have a client, but want to allow specific URLs

* Do not pass any value to `CLIENT_URL`.  
* Pass one more URLs to `CORS_ORIGIN`.

e.g.  
If you want to only allow requests from `https://www.mycustomapi.com`, then
your environment variables should look like

```bash
CORS_ORIGIN='https://www.mycustomapi.com'
```

Similarly, if you want to only allow requests from `https://www.mycustomapi1.com`
and `https://www.mycustomapi2.com`, then

```bash
CORS_ORIGIN='https://www.mycustomapi1.com, https://www.mycustomapi2.com'
```

:::tip
Spaces around commas do not matter.
:::

### Allow all requests

:::warning
This is not recommended in production usually, but there are legitimate use 
cases (eg. if you have a microservice that can be used by an arbitrary amount
of clients from different deployments). Make sure your server authenticates
requests in some other fashion if doing this.
:::

* Do not pass any value to `CLIENT_URL`.  
* Do not pass any value to `CORS_ORIGIN`.  

You'll end up with no whitelist, effectively allowing all requests to be processed.
