# Apollo GraphQL Explorer

<Tag>Added in 4.5.0</Tag>

:::info
This feature will only be on if your `NODE_ENV` is `development` and 
`useGraphQLServer` config option is set to `true`.
:::

When running a GraphQL server in development, you can go to the `/graphql`
endpoint of your server in your browser and access the Apollo Studio Explorer.

This will allow you to 
* Interact with your GraphQL API without needing a client running
* Navigate through the entire schema and read its documentation

e.g.  
If your server is running at `localhost:3000`, go to `localhost:3000/graphql`.
