# Measure GraphQL resolver performance

<Tag>Added in 4.6.0</Tag>

:::info
This feature is only on when `NDDE_ENV` is `development`.
:::

When running resolvers, the logs will provide a report of the time it took For
the resolver to execute.

For example
```
Resolver performance: query MyUsers took 0.00457 seconds
```

Make sure your queries are **named**.

e.g.  
```graphql
# MyUsers is the name of the query in this example
query MyUsers {
  users {
    result {
      id
      username
    }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

:::note
The resolver performance report will only apply to the top-level resolver that
is executed. i.e. If some of the properties requested have their own resolvers,
those will not be individually reported.
