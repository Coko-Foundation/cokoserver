# Inspecting with a debugger

<Tag>Added in 4.4.0</Tag>

When starting the server with `start-dev`, coko server automatically opens an
inspector port (`9229` by default) that your debugger can connect to.

On startup, you should see a log along the lines of:
```
Debugger listening on ws://0.0.0.0:9229/279b953c-38d3-4bb1-80c4-d18a47fa95ec
```

The port used can be overridden with the `inspectorPort` configuration property.

## Exposing the debugger in your app

First, map the `inspectorPort` configuration property to an environment
variable in the `custom-environment-variables.js` file.

```js
// config/custom-environment-variables.js

module.exports = {
  // ...
  inspectorPort: 'INSPECTOR_PORT',
}
```

Then, in your docker compose file, you need to
1. Pass this variable to the environment
2. Map a port on the host to the inspector port inside container

```yml
services:
  server:
    ports:
      # Map port on the host to port inside the container
      - ${INSPECTOR_PORT:-9229}:${INSPECTOR_PORT:-9229}
    environment:
      # Pass variable value to container
      - INSPECTOR_PORT=${INSPECTOR_PORT:-9229}
```

## Setting up the debugger (Visual Studio Code)

Switch to the "Run and Debug" tab on the left. You will need to create or edit
a `launch.json` file. What we want to do is set the debugger to listen to the
mapped port on the host, so that it attaches itself inside the running docker
container.

This is an example configuration to make that work:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach to Docker",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "port": 9229, // or whatever port you are using
      "address": "0.0.0.0",
      "restart": true,
      "remoteRoot": "/home/node/app",

      // Change this to the location of your server code
      // eg. ${workspaceFolder}/packages/server
      "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  ]
}
```

After creating the debugger launch configuration, make sure you select it from
the dropdown on the top left. You should now be able to add breakpoints.
